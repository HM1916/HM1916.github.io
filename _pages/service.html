<p>Combining case studies and story telling with numerical analysis of outcomes is an effective way of communicating the benefits of your project. We gather the information to enable us to this via:
  <ul>
    <li>Face to face and telephone interviews</li>
    <li>Focus groups and Workshops</li>
    <li>Postal and Web based Surveys</li>
