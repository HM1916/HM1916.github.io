What personal data do we collect?
Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). 
We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows: 
•	Identity Data includes first name, maiden name, last name, marital status, title, date of birth and gender. 
•	Contact Data includes home address, email address and telephone numbers. 
•	Profile Data includes your interests, preferences, feedback and survey responses. 
•	Special Categories of Personal Data includes details about ethnicity, sexual orientation and information about your health.

 
How do we collect personal data?
We may collect personal data in a variety of different ways:
•	Face to face during meetings, interviews or focus groups
•	Online using third party online survey software
•	Over the telephone
•	Paper questionnaires 
•	Via email 
Why do we collect this data?
We collect this information in order to provide evaluation and/or research services contracted by the organisation you are working/volunteering for, a member of or are a service user of. This allows us to provide advice, analysis and reporting on the outcomes of services and projects. Most often this helps voluntary and statutory organisations to understand the difference their project/service is making. This may then be used to develop the project/service further and to evidence impact when applying for further funding. 
We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
•	Where you have given explicit consent for us to use your data for the specified purposes
•	Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you. 
•	Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. 
•	Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
Disclosures of your personal data 
We may share your personal data with the organisation contracting Luminaire Consultancy in order to fulfil the requirements of the contract. When this is the case, we will seek explicit consent from you to do so. We will also ensure any information shared is anonymous and will not include any identity or contact data. 

Data security 
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed;
•	Documents such as PDFs and Microsoft Excel sheets containing data are encrypted and password protected;
•	Any paper-based data is kept in a secure office. It is transferred to computer as soon as possible and the original destroyed;
•	Any face to face or telephone interviews recorded by Dictaphone are transferred to computer and deleted from the device as soon as possible; A data protection risk assessment is carried out on each occasion of use to minimise risk of theft or loss of data;
•	Industry standard cloud-based services such as Dropbox and Microsoft 365 compliant with GDPR are used. Both also comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Frameworks;
•	Online survey software is only used with the highest level of security and where it is in compliance with GDPR standards. We use software with EU based servers such as Survey Gizmo or Smart Survey.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. 
Data retention 
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. 
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

Your legal rights 
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to: 
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. 
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. 
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. 
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms. 
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. 
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. 
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. 
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us. 
What we may need from you 
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. 
Time limit to respond 
We will respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
